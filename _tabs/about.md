My name is Miles Howell, and I'm a builder at heart. My journey through technology hasn't been a straight line — it started with a childhood curiosity that's since grown, thanks to a foundation in physics, mathematics and systems engineering, into a professional passion. I now focus on unraveling the unexpected, emergent behaviors we're beginning to find in current LLMs.

This background gives me a unique perspective. I see ML not just as abstract algorithms, but as a part of a larger system — one that involves clean code, thoughtful user experience, and real-world application. How will AI evolve alongside humanity? And will the two ever meaningfully intertwine? 

### Why This Blog?

Professionally, I run [Planned Pixel Studio](https://www.plannedpixel.com), where I help businesses build a strong online presence. But this blog is a space for something different. It's a place for exploration.

> While the AI world is buzzing with large-scale models and mainstream applications, I believe some of the most fascinating challenges lie in the margins. This blog is my commitment to exploring the underrepresented, niche, and often-overlooked areas of machine learning research.

My goal is to dive deep into topics that don't always make the headlines but hold immense potential for innovation and impact.

### What You Can Expect

Here, we'll venture beyond the basics. I'll be documenting my projects, sharing my findings, and thinking out loud about the future of intelligent systems.

> Expect posts on topics like:
> - Exploring emergent properties as ML models continue to scale. 
> - Fine-tuning smaller, specialized language models for unique tasks.
> - Creative applications of semantic search and vector embeddings.
> - The intersection of ML and cybersecurity.
> - Building practical, human-centered AI tools from the ground up.
